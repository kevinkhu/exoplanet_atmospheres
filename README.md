# Exoplanet Atmospheres

This repository contains tutorials to model exoplanet atmospheres using publicly available data, models, and tools. Each tutorial is intended to run as [Google Colab Jupyter Notebooks](https://colab.research.google.com/) so users *do not* need to install Python or any associated packages on their own computers! All that is required is a free Google account.

To run a tutorial, click on the link above, then click the *Open in Colab* button at the top of the notebook and follow along with the instructions. The two currently available tutorials are *Exoplanet Archive Atmospheric Forward Model Fitting* and *Exoplanet Archive Atmospheric Retrieval with PLATON*. Both codes interface with [Transmission Spectroscopy](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/cgi-bin/TblView/nph-tblView?app=ExoTbls&config=transitspec) and [Planetary Systems Composite Data](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/cgi-bin/TblView/nph-tblView?app=ExoTbls&config=PSCompPars) from the [NASA Exoplanet Archive](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu).
